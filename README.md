# Fingerprint-Recognition-Project
Hi, this is ZAWAD. I have done this project in my university 2nd year. In this project, if I input an unknown fingerprint, it will compare with its own dataset of fingerprints and then will show the output. If matches, then it will show the person's name whose fingerprint has been taken as input, otherwise it will show 'Try Again'.
